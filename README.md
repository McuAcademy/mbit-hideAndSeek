# Hide and Seek - micro:bit Project

## Summary

This is a project which uses multiple micro:bit boards to play a game of hide and seek using their bluetooth wireless radios. One board is configured as a “hider” which sends our a repeating signal. The other board is a “seeker” which detects the hider's signal to pinpoint the hiding spot.
